# Vehicle Detection of Specific Color with Haar Cascades

It does not simply recognize the vehicle but recognizes and shows the vehicle of a specific color.

The reason why we made this program:
When watching the movie, there is a scene where the suspect flees in a car.
At this time, we can see a scene in which the vehicle is inquired and tracked through the CCTV on the road.
After watching these scenes, we thought about creating a program that can detect a specific vehicle.
Of course, the program we made is being used in a more advanced form, still, it was meaningful to make a program based on what we learned during the semester.
